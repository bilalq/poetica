After trudging through thick mist and marsh,
I found myself lost in Grief,
And discovered a world, cruel and harsh,
Where Agony reigned chief.

Alone at first, I was therein,
Until Rage came and stood by my side.
He gave me strength to his akin,
And was there for me, when I cried.

As my tears began to fall,
They gathered around me a sea of Despair.
I drowned in regrets, large and small,
And not a soul in the world seemed to care.

In these struggles, I was never again alone,
For Misery always kept me company.
I gazed at Sorrow upon his throne,
And Darkness was all that I could see.

Truth is One, it’s absolute and final,
Yet truth seems many, diverse, and varied,
Like a river’s streaming channel,
Always changing, never steadied.

Yes, truth is many, diverse, and varied,
In the eyes of mortal men.
Always changing, never steadied,
In the histories we pen.

In the eyes of mortal men,
Pure Truth cannot be seen.
The histories which we pen,
Are merely what we glean.

Pure Truth cannot be seen,
Yet, it truly must be there.
That which we do glean,
Is but a single share.

Truly Truth must be there,
Like a river’s streaming channel.
Though all we have is a single share,
Truth is One, it’s absolute and final.

Mornings, wow, what a hassle
Get up, go back to sleep, get up again, only to sleep some more,
Repeat that over and over again a few times.
Hit the bathroom, brush teeth, shower, and shave (maybe).
Get dressed, then
make breakfast, eat breakfast, clean up breakfast.
Rush out, rush back in to grab things forgotten, then rush out again,
even faster this time.
Great start, running late.
Stuck in slow, stagnant streets.
Terrible traffic takes too long to move.
Get there late, can’t find parking,
This lot’s full, keep looking.
Run out into pouring rain,
Strong winds inverting the umbrella.
Hop on the bus, hop off, then hop on another one.
Buses don’t care that people are late,
wait ten minutes before moving.
Hop off again, now run to class.
Typical tragedy, nothing special.
Everyday story of a commuter’s morning.
